# SignVista
This is my 6th semester minor project  
Sign vista is a sign language detection  system designed to  capture live web cam feed and detect hand signs 
It is a ML project  using the concepts of  opencv to  capture  live web-cam feed  and detect sign language gestures using the LSTM model .
